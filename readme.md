# Hello everyone

### Introduce 
<p> It's so amazing that I can introduce you my express template.

Everything what has been build here, used to be your manager. For what?
thats simple, when you are using thins template, you can build your 
next great idea so much faster! </p>

### Core Dependecies
- Express
- Cors
- Bcrypt

### Why it's so simple?

Because of express framework, which allows you, to create whole 
server and so on. Here is my config:

````javascript

````
The module called cors can be using for example axios, when you are
fatching data here's an example:

````javascript

axios.get("http://someDomain.xyz/abc")
    .then(result => {
        array = result.data
    })
    .catch(error => {
       errorArray = error
    });

````

### How to handle routes?
It is preey straight forward! The only thing which you have to do, to add really new route
is to write something like that

```javascript

router.[http action]('name', (req, res) => /* Do some stuff */)

// Where [http action] -> [get, post, delete, update]

```
### How is frontend structured

I was wondering how to create a modern frontend solution. 
I've wanted to create that with handlebars usage, but it was unfortunate.

Now, this project is built VIA react

## Where can I find logic of server? 
Logic of the application is located in app/ directory.
